# sf-weather-widget
A simple page that always renders the SF widget from Dark Sky. For embedding in [Notion](notion.so)

Notion unfortunately does not allow you to embed raw HTML pages, but that sort of embedding is typical of widget-generators such as Dark Sky.

I use the `Embed` widget and include a link to `https://eatbigger.fish/sf-weather-widget` with optional `/detailed` sub-path for this useful daily information to appear in my Notion page.
